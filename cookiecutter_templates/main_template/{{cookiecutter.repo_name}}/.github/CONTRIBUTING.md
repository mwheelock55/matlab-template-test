# Contributing

**Contributions do not have to be code!**  
If you spot unclear documentation, have a great example of how to use something, or want to suggest improvements, please contribute! We welcome:
- Bug reports
- Feature suggestions
- Documentation fixes
- Examples and tutorials
- Pull requests with code or text

Even if you're not ready to submit a solution, opening an issue is valuable.

## How to contribute

### 1. Check for existing issues  
Before starting work, [check the existing issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) to see if your idea or bug has already been reported. You can join the conversation there or add new information.

### 2. Open a new issue  
If no one has reported it yet, [create a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). Be as clear and complete as possible—others may not share your context, so include:
- Steps to reproduce the problem (if applicable)
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code

### 3. Work in a fork  
If you'd like to contribute a fix or new feature:
- [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- Clone your fork locally and create a feature branch  
  Example: `git checkout -b fix-bug-xyz`
- Make your changes and commit them in logical units  
  Use clear commit messages like `fix: correct error in file parser`.

### 4. Make a pull request  
Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) from your fork's branch to the `main` branch of this repository. Your PR will be reviewed and you may be asked to make changes. Once it's approved, we'll merge it.

## Guidelines

There are currently no formal best practices for writing MATLAB&reg; code in this project, but we recommend:

- Avoid warnings or errors in the [Code Analyzer report](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/matlab-code-analyzer-report.html)
- Follow [Loren Shure’s MATLAB Best Practices](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/category/best-practice/)
- Provide examples as [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html), and [export them as HTML](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/share-live-scripts.html) for documentation
